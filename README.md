# 🎓 Graduate School Admissions Prediction

# 📌 Overview

This project analyzes graduate school admissions data to uncover patterns and insights that can help students understand their chances of admission. By leveraging statistical and machine learning techniques, the project predicts admission probabilities and categorizes students into likelihood tiers (high or low). This analysis provides valuable guidance for prospective graduate students seeking to optimize their applications.

# 📂 Dataset

- Source: [Kaggle - Graduate Admissions Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mohansacharya/graduate-admissions)

- Description: The dataset contains records of students' GRE scores, TOEFL scores, university ratings, statements of purpose, letters of recommendation, GPA, and research experience.

# 📊 Methodology

1. Introduction - Understanding the motivation and importance of graduate school admission prediction.

2. Research Objectives - Defining key goals of the project.

3. Data Collection - Sourcing and preparing the dataset.

4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) - Visualizing key trends and correlations.

5. Machine Learning Models - Implementing regression and classification models.

# 🛠️ Machine Learning Models

This project uses two types of machine learning approaches: Regression and Classification.

1️⃣ Regression Models (Predicting Admission Probability)

- Algorithms: Random Forest, Linear Regression, SVR, LightGBM

- Evaluation Metrics: Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), R-squared (R²)

- Best Performing Models: Linear Regression Model

2️⃣ Classification Models (Categorizing Likelihood Tiers)

- Algorithms: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Support Vector Machines (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

- Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, AUC-ROC

- Best Performing Models: Logistic Regression

# 📊 Results & Visualization

Visualizations include correlation heatmaps, box plots, feature importance rankings, and ROC curves.

The best-performing model in each category is identified based on predictive performance.
